# **Henricus's User Manual (v1.6)**

*Welcome! You’ve found the user manual for Henricus. This guide is here to make working together a breeze and set us up for great teamwork. Feel free to read on—or jump right in and enjoy the ride!*

## **1. Fast Facts**

Pressed for time? Here’s what you need to know:

* **Proud Dad:** Above all else, being a dad is what defines me. If you want to see me light up, just ask about my kid.
* **Backend Enthusiast:** I love complex backend logic and the challenge of untangling tricky code.
* **Elixir & Rust Fan:** These are my languages of choice.
* **Role:** Software Developer—backend is my playground; frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) is not.
* **Best at:** Solving tough problems behind the scenes.
* **Photography Buff:** I enjoy both analog and digital photography—there’s something about film that just hits different.

## **2. How I Work Best**

Here’s how to get the most out of working with me:

* **Prime Hours:** My focus peaks in the **early morning** and **late evening**. Afternoons are best for meetings or collaborative sessions.
* **Single-Tasking:** I work best when I can focus on **one thing at a time**. Frequent context switches slow me down, so I prefer to see tasks through before moving on.
* **My Approach:** I’m a “measure twice, cut once” type. I like to think things through, sketch out a technical plan, and then dive into building.
* **Ideal Day:** Long, uninterrupted stretches of work, with meetings grouped together in the afternoon.

## **3. How to Reach Me**

Tips for smooth communication:

* **Urgent Issues:** If something is truly urgent, call me directly—phone works best.
* **Everything Else:** Please send a single message with all the context included. “Hey” or “Got a sec?” messages aren’t my favorite. Assume I don’t have background on your request. I’m happy to help, but I prefer a planned call over a surprise one.
* **Response Time:** My notifications are usually **OFF** so I can focus. Responses might not be instant, but I’ll get back to you. No need for follow-up nudges unless it’s urgent.
* **Meetings:** I appreciate meetings with a clear agenda sent in advance.

## **4. My Core Principles**

* **Curiosity First:** I’m driven by a need to understand how and why things work. Mastery and competence are big motivators for me.
* **Analytical by Nature:** I like to observe, gather information, and think before acting. I’m most comfortable when I’m well-informed.
* **Independent Streak:** I tend to rely on my own research first—not out of distrust, but because I want to feel capable.
* **Heads-Up:** My focus on logic means I might miss emotional cues or seem a bit distant, especially when I’m overloaded. It’s not personal; it’s just my way of processing.

## **5. Feedback: What Works for Me**

How to help me improve:

* **Be Specific:** I respond best to feedback that’s clear, direct, and based on facts. Logical reasoning helps me understand and grow.
* **Honesty Over Softening:** You don’t need to sugarcoat things. Clarity and honesty are the quickest path to improvement.
* **Communication Style:** I enjoy problem-solving, but complex social dynamics aren’t my specialty. Direct communication is always appreciated—I don’t always catch subtle hints.

## **6. Fun Facts**

A few things you might not guess from my code:

* I love spending my spare time playing with my kid—parenthood is my favorite adventure.
* I enjoy both analog and digital photography—there’s something about film that just hits different.
* If you’re into personality frameworks, I’m an Enneagram 5, “The Investigator.” (Basically: I ask a lot of questions.)
